Facing the need of presenting myself, I've created this website. I've put my blood, sweat and tears into this, so I hope you'll like it.
The website has simple and readable structure, so it is the most convenient for users. You can find there basic information about me,
such as: skills, hobbies or portfolio. At the end I created a formular, so you can easily fill and contact me. But at the same time
there's no lack of cool features e.g. gradient in the background or smooth scrolling. Check this out by yourself. Enjoy!
